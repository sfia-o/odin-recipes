        <h1>Tiramisu</h1>
        <img src="../images/tiramisu.jpg">
        <p>Tiramisu is really a timeless (or it is season-less?) dessert, don't you think? On that note and with the holidays coming, everything about us having to adapt, appreciate and celebrate with smaller clans, here is a recipe that I really think would be useful. A tiramisu for two, it's eggless and the small batch helps us avoid food waste.

            Sounds good to you? Ok, let's go!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>Mascarpone Cream</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>110g full fat mascarpone cheese</li>

            <li>125ml whipping cream, min 35% fat (chilled)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Coffee Mixture</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>125ml water</li>
            <li>2 tbs instant coffee</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Mascarpone Cream</h4>
            <li>Add mascarpone cheese and sugar into a bowl. Whisk until fluffy using a handheld whisk. Now add vanilla extracta and whipping cream. Continue whisking until you get a thick stiff cream. Don't over mix to avoid splitting. Set aside.</li>
            <h4>Coffee Mixture</h4>
            <li>Mix water, coffee and sugar in a wide flat container until sugar is dissolved. Set aside.</li>
            <h4>Assembing</h4>
            <li>Soak ladyfingers in the coffee for a few seconds and arrange at the bottom of 2 glasses of 1 cup (250ml). Dust cocoa powder. Spoon and divide hald of mascarpone mixture into the glasses. Repeat with more ladyfingers and the rest of the cream.</li>
            <li>Serve directly. Optional - chill in the fridge for 1-2 hours for a firmer texture.
                Dust the top with cocoa powder right before serving.</li>
